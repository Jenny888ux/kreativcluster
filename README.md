kreativcluster
==============

KreativCluster lets you create interactive graphs of related keywords and images. It currently is based on the Flickr API and uses related tags to find interesting connections between seemingly unrelated Keywords.

Double-click to expand a keyword. Use the Eraser to remove elements. The connector lets you add connections. Save your creation to PDF.

KreativCluster is written in Processing and uses the following Libraries:
- fullscreen.*;
- controlP5.*;
- traer.physics.*;
- processing.pdf.*;
They can be found at http://processing.org/reference/libraries/

I am not entirely sure about the version used initially but around October 2009 Processing 1.0.7 was the latest release.
